**Online tiffin/catering service**

I created this website for some of my friends. They had  a startup dealing with tiffin service in and around bangalore. They wanted me to create a quick website where they can show their tiffin menus and take online order. They wanted it quick and dirty and cheap ofcourse.

To come up with a fast solution , I used some templates, bootstrap and created the website. Since they wanted it less expensive , so I used php and mysql so that the hosting cost will be reduced. This was my first project learning angular and php. The projects needs lot of improvements buy it was effective and serverd the purpose. This was created sometime around 2014-15. This was turnaround in weeks time.

Feature :
1. Dynamic webpages with menu and dishes list. Jquery, Angular, bootstrap
2.  Online ordering page -- 
		 - Cash on delivery
         - Paytm integration
3. Oauth integration with google and facebook
4. Admin page to store and edit the menu and scheme. Used MySQL database

The site was hosted in bigdaddy but no longer running.
